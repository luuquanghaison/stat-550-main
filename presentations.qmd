## Procedure

1.  On the shared Google Sheet. Put a number (in the column with your name) indicating your Top 3 choices. You must do this by 28 January at noon. If you don't, you'll be assigned whatever is left.
2.  I'll make final assignments by 31 January.
3.  Be ready to present by the listed date for your assignment. Your presentation may happen a few days later, but you must be ready on the listed date.

## Expectations

Time: 15 min followed by 5-10 minute of Q&A.

-   Expect some immediate feedback/criticism from me. Try not to take this too hard. The intention is to help everyone improve.

-   You can use any software to prepare your oral presentation. Topics are simple but useful in consulting. The first \~10 minutes should be targeted toward a general audience. The remaining \~5 minutes should be more technical, targeted toward your classmates.

-   The references above are meant to be good starting points. You can follow them if you like, but this is not required. You can begin with the papers given, but you must complement them with other references.

#### Rubric

You'll be evaluated on

- content (7), 
- presentation skills (3), 
- clarity of the slides (4), 
- and time management (1).

#### Deliverable

-   No matter how you create your presentation (.Rmd, Google slides, .pptx, .keynote), you must upload the slides (and only the slides) to the `presentations` repo no later than **3** days before the "projected presentation date".
-   You should do this via pull request.
-   The name of your file should be `xx-topic-title` where `xx` is the two digit number of your presentation, `topic` is self-explanatory, and `title` is the first word in the title.
-   For example, `06-modelling-association.pdf` for presentation 6.\
-   I'll allow .html, .pdf, or a link to something public (say with `06-modelling-association.md` containing only a link). No .pptx or .keynote.

You must have a slide (toward the back, not necessarily shown during the presentation) with a list of useful references. These must be properly formatted using a standard style. I suggest following *Annals of Applied Statistics* (see [here](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-applied-statistics/annals-of-applied-statistics-next-issues/) for examples) or *Canadian Journal of Statistics*. You will not receive full marks if the only references are those listed above.
