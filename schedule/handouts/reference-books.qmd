::: .callout-note
These are [Prof. Harry Joe's](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/harry-joe) suggestions for resources on different statistical topics that students might not be exposed to before Stat 550/551.
:::


The student can also learn about the topic and not just about how an R function works. 

Books with R in the title are generally not good for learning the theory. 

A book reference with theory and good examples is better than a URL.

: 
: This book covers many cases. However the principle of sample size calculation can be shown better in a few pages based on examples that show the derivation of the distribution of the test statistic under a point null hypothesis and under a point alternative hypothesis.
