What does it take to write journal articles?\n\n\n## What is \"read\"?\n\n* Start with titles, then abstracts, then intro+conclusion\n* Each is a filter to determine how far to go\n* Pass 3 filters, [read]{.secondary} the paper (should take about ~30 minutes)\n* Don't get bogged down in notation, proofs\n* Organize your documents somehow, make notes in the margins, etc\n* After you [read]{.secondary} it, you should be able to tell me what they show, why it's important, why it's novel\n* If you can, figure out [how]{.tertiary} they show something. This is hard.\n\n\n## How to find and organize papers\n\n* arXiv, AOS, JASA, JCGS have RSS feeds, email lists etc\n* Find a statistician you like who filters\n* Follow reading groups\n* Conference proceedings\n* Become an IMS member, SSC member (ASA costs money:( )\n* BibDesk, Zotero\n\n## Ideal outcome\n\n* If you need to learn something, you can teach yourself\n* Know how to find the basics on the internet\n* Know how to go in depth with real sources\n* Collect a set of resources that you can turn to regularly\n* If you need to read a book, you can\n* If you need to pick up a new coding language, you can\n\n. . .\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## What this doesn't mean\n\nYou are not expected to have all the answers at the tips of your fingers.\n:::\n\nBut you should get progressively good at finding them.",
